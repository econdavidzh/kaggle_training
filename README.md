## Intro:
1. Arithmetic and Variables: Make calculations, and define and modify variables.
2. Functions: Organize your code and avoid redundancy.
3. Data Types: Explore integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
4. Conditions and Conditional Statements: Modify how functions run, depending on the input.
5. Intro to Lists: Organize your data so you can work with it efficiently.

## Python:
1. Hello, Python: A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers.
2. Functions and Getting Help: Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation.
3. Booleans and Conditionals: Using booleans for branching logic.
4. Lists: Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating.
5. Loops and List Comprehensions: For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions.
6. Strings and Dictionaries: Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types.
7. Working with External Libraries: Imports, operator overloading, and survival tips for venturing into the world of external libraries.

## Intro to Machine Learning:
1. How Models Work: The first step if you're new to machine learning.
2. Basic Data Exploration: Load and understand your data.
3. Your First Machine Learning Model: Building your first model. Hurray!
4. Model Validation: Measure the performance of your model, so you can test and compare alternatives.
5. Underfitting and Overfitting: Fine-tune your model for better performance.
6. Random Forests: Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
7. Machine Learning Competitions: Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress.

## Pandas:
1. Creating, Reading and Writing: You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.
2. Indexing, Selecting & Assigning: Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!
3. Summary Functions and Maps: Extract insights from your data.
4. Grouping and Sorting: Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters.
5. Data Types and Missing Values: Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems.
6. Renaming and Combining: Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together.

## Intermediate Machine Learning:
1. Introduction: Review what you need for this course.
2. Missing Values: Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.
3. Categorical Variables: There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning.
4. Pipelines: A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.
5. Cross-Validation: A better way to test your models.
6. XGBoost: The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.
7. Data Leakage: Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.

## Data Visualization:
1. Hello, Seaborn: Your first introduction to coding for data visualization.
2. Line Charts: Visualize trends over time.
3. Bar Charts and Heatmaps: Use color or length to compare categories in a dataset.
4. Scatter Plots: Leverage the coordinate plane to explore relationships between variables.
5. Distributions: Create histograms and density plots
6. Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles: Customize your charts and make them look snazzy.
7. Final Project: Practice for real-world application.

## Feature Engineering:
2. Mutual Information: Locate features with the most potential.
3. Creating Features: Transform features with Pandas to suit your model.

5. Principal Component Analysis: Discover new features by analyzing variation.
6. Target Encoding: Boost any categorical feature with this powerful technique.

## Time Series:
1. Linear Regression With Time Series: Use two features unique to time series: lags and time steps.
2. Trend: Model long-term changes with moving averages and the time dummy.
3. Seasonality: Create indicators and Fourier features to capture periodic change.
4. Time Series as Features: Predict the future from the past with a lag embedding.
5. Hybrid Models: Combine the strengths of two forecasters with this powerful technique.
6. Forecasting With Machine Learning: Apply ML to any forecasting task with these four strategies.
